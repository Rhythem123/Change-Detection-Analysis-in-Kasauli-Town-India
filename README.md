Change Detection of Vegetation in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh

Project Overview

The objective of this study is to detect changes in the vegetation pattern of Kasauli town in Solan district, Himachal Pradesh, India over the years 2018, 2020, and 2022. This report focuses on using Python for change detection analysis using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)

NDVI is an index used in remote sensing to assess and quantify the health and amount of vegetation present in an area. It provides information about vegetation density and health status by measuring the difference between the reflectance of red and near-infrared light.

NIR (Band 5): Reflectance in the near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Red (Band 4): Reflectance in the red band (visible portion) of the electromagnetic spectrum.
NDVI Range and Interpretation
-1 to +1: Range of NDVI values.
Higher positive values: Indicate dense and healthy vegetation.
Lower values: Indicate sparse and stressed vegetation.
Vegetation and NDVI Values
0 - 0.2: Bare soil, water bodies, or urban areas.
0.2 - 0.4: Sparse or stressed vegetation.
0.4 - 0.6: Moderate vegetation with better health conditions.
Vegetation in Kasauli
Kasauli town is home to various species including oak, pine, deodar cedar, Berberis, and Rhododendron. Observations indicate changes in vegetation pattern and health over time.

Study Objective

This study aims to report changes in vegetation pattern and health status from 2018 to 2022, providing insights into the improvement of vegetation cover and health in Kasauli.

Conclusion

2018: Little or no vegetation cover.
2020: Sparse vegetation.
2022: Moderate vegetation cover with better health conditions.
Overall, the vegetation cover and health have improved in Kasauli from 2018 to 2022.
